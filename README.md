# Simple RAG Agent  

A lightweight **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline** built in Python. This tool ingests PDF documents, indexes them using semantic embeddings, and enables interactive question-answering with context-aware responses generated by **Qwen2-1.5B-Instruct**.  

## 🚀 Features  
- 📄 **PDF ingestion** with text cleaning  
- ✂️ **Chunking** for long documents with overlap handling  
- 🔍 **Semantic search** using Sentence Transformers + FAISS  
- 🤖 **Contextual answers** with citations from Qwen2-1.5B-Instruct  
- ⌨️ **Interactive CLI** to ask questions in real time  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- [Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) (Qwen for generation)  
- [Sentence-Transformers](https://www.sbert.net/) (MiniLM for embeddings)  
- [FAISS](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss) (vector search)  
- [PyPDF](https://pypi.org/project/pypdf/) (PDF text extraction)  
- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)  

# Usage  

Run the agent with:  
```bash
python rag_agent.py -k 10
